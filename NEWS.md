Version 0.1.7 2020-06-23

Options for function gg_varpart to format variance component values as
percentages and append mean component variance to legend label. Thanks to
Christian Supsup for suggesting this.

Version 0.1.6 2019-03-25

Option to draw caterpillar plots with a single colour.

Version 0.1.5 2018-12-18

Updated to work with boral package version 1.7, in which the number of latent
variables is set via the new lv.control list argument to the boral function.
The ggboral package now requires boral >= 1.7 but plotting functions will
still work with saved model objects from earlier versions.
